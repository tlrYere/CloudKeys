# CloudKeys
senior year capstone project: a completely cloud-based secure password manager

To run server, download node.js and npm and use command "npm install" to automatically download all dependencies.
For early versions (using fs as a sort of mock database) be sure to create /private/passwords directory (from the root directory of the project)
to get app to save and fetch passwords properly.
